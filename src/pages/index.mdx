# <PurpleText>Welcome</PurpleText>

These docs provide an overview of the GobletQA Platform, and its key features. Whether you are a novice trying to learn more about test automtion or an experienced developer seeking an easier and stright forward test solution, the GobletQA Platform offers a user-friendly environment for writing and executing various types of tests and automation.<br/>

## <PurpleText>What is GobletQA?</PurpleText>

The GobletQA Platform is a Cloud SASS __(Software as a Service)__ application designed to empower user of all skill sets to create a wide range tests and automation processes.<br/>
It facilitates a __low-code/no-code__ solution for non-developers through [feature files](/guides/feature-file) written in the Gherkin syntax, while simultaneously enhancing the productivity, capabilities of power users with its user-friendly interface and intuitive design.<br/>

## <PurpleText>Key Features</PurpleText>

The GobletQA Platform encompasses several key features that make it a powerful tool for creation and execution of tests or automation. These features include:

### <GreenText>Predefined Step Definitions</GreenText>

  The platform provides a comprehensive set of predefined step definitions that users can leverage while creating feature files. These step definitions cover a wide range of areas such as making API calls, browser automation, script execution, and more. Users can easily select and incorporate these step definitions into their test scenarios using the integrated search and auto-complete functionality.

  * <GrayText>**Assertion Steps**</GrayText><br/>
    To ensure the correct outcome of test steps, the GobletQA Platform includes a variety of assertion steps. These steps allow users to validate the expected results and ensure the accuracy of the tests.
    <br/>
  * <GrayText>**Custom Step Definitions**</GrayText><br/>
    For users with coding experience, the platform offers the flexibility to create custom step definitions. These custom step definitions can be seamlessly integrated into the feature files alongside the built-in step definitions, expanding the range of test scenarios that can be created.
    <br/>
    <br/>

### <GreenText>Integrations</GreenText>

  The GobletQA Platform integrates with popular open source technologies to support its functionality. It leverages the Playwright framework for automating web browsers, allowing users to interact with browsers, perform actions such as clicking, scrolling, and DOM manipulation, and validate the behavior of their applications.

  * <GrayText>**No Vendor Lock-In**</GrayText><br/>
    Becasue it uses open source technologies; the tests and automation scripts are not held hostage by a popritary framework. This significtly reduces risk by allowing users to continue executing their code with or without using the platform.
    <br/>
    <br/>

### <GreenText>API and Unit Testing Support</GreenText>

  The platform provides support for writing API and unit tests using JavaScript or TypeScript and the Jest test framework.

  * <GrayText>**Script and Function Execution**</GrayText><br/>
    Users can execute their own scripts or functions within an isolated virtual machine with a stable and consistent environment. This ensures security and reliability while allowing users to perform custom actions or implement business logic specific to their requirments.
    <br/>
    <br/>

### <GreenText>Streamlined UI</GreenText>

  The platform interface offers a seamless and intuitive experience, combining the power of the Monaco IDE and the VNC-powered browser in a split pane view. This unique UI layout enhances productivity and provides users with comprehensive control over their testing and automation workflows.

  * <GrayText>**Monaco IDE**</GrayText><br/>
    The editor offers essential features such as **auto-complete**, **code highlighting**, and **full-text search**, simplifying the test creation process. This is the same editor that powers [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    <br/>
  * <GrayText>**Browser Inception**</GrayText><br/>
    The integrated VNC-powered browser, is a powerful tool that brings test automation to life. This browser provides a fully interactive and real-time view of test execution, allowing users to witness their tests and automation scripts in action. This immersive experience significantly reduces the feedback loop between code development and test execution, enabling users to validate and fine-tune their tests with precision.
    <br/>
  * <GrayText>**Real-time Interaction**</GrayText><br/>
    The split pane view, combining the Monaco IDE and the VNC-powered browser, offers a cohesive workspace that fosters efficiency and convenience. Users can seamlessly switch between writing code in the IDE and observing the test execution in the browser, providing a holistic view of their testing process. This integrated approach enhances the development workflow, enabling users to iterate quickly, troubleshoot effectively, and ensure their tests and automation are running as expected.
    <br/>
    <br/>

### <GreenText>Git Integration</GreenText>

  Through the seamless integration with the [git cli](https://git-scm.com), any changes made within the platform are automatically synced with your [git cloud provider](/overview/git-providers). It does this by leveraging the __commit__ and __push__ commands to continuously sync all changes up to a git remote repository, facilitating collaboration and easy sharing of code among team members.
