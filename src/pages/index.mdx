# Welcome to the GobletQA Platform documentation!

This section provides an overview of the GobletQA Platform, its purpose, and its key features. Whether you are a non-developer looking to create tests or an experienced developer seeking a low-code solution, the GobletQA Platform offers a user-friendly environment for writing and executing various types of tests.

What is the GobletQA Platform?

The GobletQA Platform is a Cloud SASS (Software as a Service) application designed to empower non-developers to create different test types, including automated tests, integration tests, and unit tests. It serves as a low-code/no-code solution, enabling users to define test scenarios using feature files written in the Gherkin syntax.

Key Features of the GobletQA Platform

The GobletQA Platform encompasses several key features that make it a powerful tool for test creation and execution. These features include:

Predefined Step Definitions: The platform provides a comprehensive set of predefined step definitions that users can leverage while creating feature files. These step definitions cover a wide range of areas such as making API calls, browser automation, script execution, and more. Users can easily select and incorporate these step definitions into their test scenarios.

Assertion Steps: To ensure the correct outcome of test steps, the GobletQA Platform includes a variety of assertion steps. These steps allow users to validate the expected results and ensure the accuracy of the tests.

Custom Step Definitions: For users with coding experience, the platform offers the flexibility to create custom step definitions. These custom step definitions can be seamlessly integrated into the feature files alongside the built-in step definitions, expanding the range of test scenarios that can be created.

Integration with Open Source Technologies: The GobletQA Platform integrates with popular open source technologies to support its functionality. It leverages the Playwright framework for automating web browsers, allowing users to interact with browsers, perform actions such as clicking, scrolling, and DOM manipulation, and verify the behavior of web applications.

Script and Function Execution: Users can execute their own scripts or functions within an isolated virtual machine created by Kubernetes and Docker. This ensures security and reliability while allowing users to perform custom actions or implement specific business logic as part of their tests.

API and Unit Testing Support: The platform provides support for writing API and unit tests using JavaScript or TypeScript and the Jest test framework. Users can write tests directly in the browser using the integrated Monaco IDE editor. The editor offers essential features such as auto-complete, code highlighting, and full-text search, simplifying the test creation process.

Real-time Browser Interaction: The GobletQA Platform incorporates a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) session using noVNC. This session allows users to visualize and interact with the browser in real-time as tests and automation are executed. It provides a responsive and dynamic environment, enabling users to observe the behavior of their code and make necessary adjustments during the development process.

Git Integration: The platform seamlessly integrates with the git command-line interface (CLI) and handles repository changes made within the GobletQA Platform. It leverages the git CLI to commit and push changes to a remote git repository, facilitating collaboration and easy sharing of repository files among team members.

With its user-friendly interface, extensive feature set, and support for a wide range of test scenarios, the GobletQA Platform simplifies the process of creating tests and executing automation, making it accessible to both novice users and experienced developers.

In the following sections, we will dive deeper into the various features and functionalities offered by the GobletQA Platform, providing detailed explanations and examples to help you make the most of this powerful testing tool.
