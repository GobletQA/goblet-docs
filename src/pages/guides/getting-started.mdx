# Getting Started

Getting Started

This section serves as a guide for users who are new to the GobletQA Platform, providing a step-by-step overview of the initial setup and key actions required to start using the platform effectively.

1. Sign Up and Authentication

Visit the GobletQA Platform website and sign up for an account.
Choose a supported Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and authenticate your account with the platform.
Grant the necessary permissions to allow the GobletQA Platform to access your repositories.
2. Repository Selection and Branch

Upon successful authentication, you will be prompted to select a repository from the authorized list.
Choose the repository you wish to work with from the provided options.
Select the desired branch within the repository that you want to use for your tests and automation.
3. Creating Feature Files

Once the repository and branch are selected, navigate to the GobletQA Platform interface.
Locate the goblet folder within your repository, or create one if it doesn't exist.
Within the goblet folder, create a new feature file using the Gherkin syntax to define your tests or automation scenarios.
Specify the steps and assertions required to validate the expected outcomes.
4. Selecting Step Definitions

The GobletQA Platform provides a set of predefined step definitions that cover a wide range of areas such as making API calls, automating browsers, executing user-supplied scripts or functions, and more.
Choose the appropriate step definitions from the available options to match your testing or automation requirements.
If needed, you can also write custom step definitions using JavaScript or TypeScript.
5. Interacting with the Integrated IDE

The GobletQA Platform features an integrated Monaco IDE editor, allowing you to write and edit your tests and automation directly within the browser.
Utilize the editor's features, such as auto-complete, code highlighting, and full-text search, to enhance your coding experience.
Leverage the custom search and auto-complete functionality specific to the GobletQA Platform and custom step definitions.
6. Browser Automation and API Testing

Depending on your use case, leverage the Playwright framework for browser automation or utilize JavaScript/TypeScript and the Jest test framework for API testing and unit tests.
For browser automation, use the Playwright framework to automate interactions with the browser, including clicking, scrolling, DOM manipulation, and more.
For API testing and unit tests, write JavaScript/TypeScript code using the Jest test framework to validate the functionality and behavior of APIs and application components.
7. Real-Time Feedback and Validation

As you write and modify your tests or automation, the GobletQA Platform offers a real-time feedback loop.
The platform utilizes a proprietary read-eval-print loop (REPL) to execute your code and provide immediate visibility into the outcome.
Interact with the feature files, code, and browser automation in real-time within the platform to ensure your tests and automation are running as expected.
8. Saving Changes and Version Control

The GobletQA Platform integrates with the Git CLI to handle changes made within the platform.
All changes to the repository are automatically saved by using the Git CLI to commit and push the changes to the remote Git repository.
This integration allows for easy collaboration within teams and ensures that changes are securely version-controlled.
9. Session Container and Security

Each user session within the GobletQA Platform is associated with a session container, providing an isolated and secure execution environment.
The session container clones the selected repository, checks



Getting Started

This section provides a brief overview of the initial steps to get started with the GobletQA Platform. Follow these steps to begin using the platform effectively:

Sign Up and Authenticate: Create an account on the GobletQA Platform website and authenticate using your preferred Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). Grant necessary permissions for repository access.

Select Repository and Branch: After authentication, choose the repository and branch you want to work with for your tests and automation.

Create Feature Files: Within the repository's goblet folder (create if it doesn't exist), write feature files using the Gherkin syntax to define your tests or automation scenarios. Specify steps and assertions for expected outcomes.

Choose Step Definitions: Select step definitions from the provided set or write custom ones in JavaScript or TypeScript to match your testing or automation requirements.

Use Integrated IDE: Leverage the integrated Monaco IDE editor to write and edit your tests and automation. Benefit from features like auto-complete, code highlighting, and full-text search.

Browser Automation and API Testing: Use Playwright for browser automation, allowing interactions with the browser. Use JavaScript/TypeScript and Jest for API testing and unit tests.

Real-Time Feedback: The GobletQA Platform offers real-time feedback through its proprietary read-eval-print loop (REPL). Execute code and interact with features, code, and browser automation in real-time.

Save Changes and Version Control: Changes made in the platform are automatically saved using the Git CLI. Collaboration is made easy with secure version control.

Session Container and Security: Each user session is associated with an isolated session container, ensuring security. The container clones the repository, executes code securely, and cleans up after the session ends.

Follow these steps to quickly start using the GobletQA Platform for creating tests, validating code, and executing automation with ease.
