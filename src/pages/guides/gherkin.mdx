# Gherkin Syntax

A feature file is a crucial component of the GobletQA Platform that defines the behavior and requirements of your tests or automation scenarios. In this section, you will learn how to write a feature file using the Gherkin syntax, ensuring clear and understandable test descriptions.

Understanding Gherkin Syntax: Gherkin is a plain-text, human-readable language that follows a specific syntax to describe the behavior of software. It uses keywords to structure the feature file, making it easily understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Creating a Feature: Begin by creating a new feature file within the goblet folder of your selected repository. Give it a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the tests or automation scenario.

Feature Description: Start the feature file with the Feature keyword followed by a brief description of the feature being tested. This description should provide high-level context and understanding of what the feature entails.

Scenarios: Scenarios are individual test cases or automation scenarios that validate specific behaviors. Begin each scenario with the Scenario keyword, followed by a descriptive title that summarizes the scenario's objective.

Scenario Steps: Within each scenario, describe the steps necessary to execute the test or automation scenario. Use keywords such as Given, When, and Then to structure the steps.

Given represents the preconditions or initial state required before executing the scenario.
When represents the action or event that triggers the scenario.
Then represents the expected outcome or result of the scenario.
It's recommended to keep the steps concise, specific, and written in a declarative manner.

Scenario Outlines: If you have multiple similar scenarios with varying inputs or data, you can use scenario outlines to avoid duplication. Define placeholders or variables within the steps using <placeholder> syntax and provide different values in the scenario outline examples.

Background: The Background keyword allows you to define a set of common steps that are shared among multiple scenarios within a feature. Use the Background section to specify steps that are executed before each scenario, reducing repetition and improving maintainability.

Tags: Tags provide a way to categorize and organize feature files and scenarios. Use the @tagname syntax to add tags to your feature file or specific scenarios. Tags can be used for filtering and selecting specific tests during execution.

Comments: Add comments to your feature file using the # symbol. Comments can provide additional context, explanations, or serve as reminders for yourself or other collaborators.

By following the Gherkin syntax and structuring your feature files effectively, you can create clear, concise, and understandable tests and automation scenarios within the GobletQA Platform.
