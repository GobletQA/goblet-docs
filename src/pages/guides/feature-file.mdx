# Writing a feature file

In the GobletQA Platform, creating a feature file is a straightforward process that allows you to define your tests or automation scenarios using an intuitive interface. Follow these steps to write a feature file within the platform:

Access the Monaco IDE: Log in to the GobletQA Platform and navigate to the repository and branch where you want to create the feature file. Open the Monaco IDE, which is an integrated code editor within the platform.

Create a New Feature File: Within the Monaco IDE, click on the "New File" button or use the provided shortcut to create a new file. Give the file a descriptive name with the .feature extension. This file will serve as your feature file.

Writing Scenarios: Begin writing your scenarios within the feature file. Start with a descriptive title for each scenario, encapsulating its objective.

Using Step Definitions: The GobletQA Platform provides a set of predefined step definitions that cover a wide range of areas such as making API calls, automating a browser, executing user-supplied scripts or functions, and more. Select the appropriate step definitions from the available options to define the steps of your scenario.

Asserting the Outcome: The predefined step definitions also include assertion steps that allow you to validate the outcome of previous steps. Use these assertion steps to ensure that the expected results are achieved.

Leveraging Custom Step Definitions: If the predefined step definitions don't fulfill your specific requirements, you can create custom step definitions. These custom step definitions can be written in JavaScript or TypeScript and used immediately within your feature file. This gives you the flexibility to extend the platform's functionality to match your testing or automation needs.

Utilizing Search and Auto-Complete: The Monaco IDE integrated within the GobletQA Platform offers powerful search and auto-complete functionality. Take advantage of this feature to quickly find and use the predefined step definitions, as well as your custom step definitions, while writing your feature file. It saves time and ensures accuracy in your test or automation scenarios.

Save and Commit: As you write your feature file, the changes are automatically saved within the Monaco IDE. Once you have completed writing your scenarios, ensure that you save the feature file and commit the changes using the Git integration provided by the GobletQA Platform. This helps in version control and collaboration with your team members.

By utilizing the Monaco IDE and the available step definitions within the GobletQA Platform, you can efficiently write feature files that define your tests or automation scenarios. The integrated functionality of search, auto-complete, and custom step definitions allows for a smooth and productive writing experience, empowering you to create powerful and customized tests within the platform.
