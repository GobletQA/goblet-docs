# Authentication

Authentication is a crucial aspect of the GobletQA Platform, ensuring secure access and protecting user data. This section outlines the authentication process employed by the platform and the supported authentication providers.

User Authentication Process

Supported Git Providers: The GobletQA Platform supports authentication with two popular Git providers: GitHub and GitLab. Users are required to sign in with their accounts from one of these providers to access the platform.

Granting Repository Access: Upon signing in, the platform prompts the user to grant permission for the GobletQA Platform to access their repositories. This permission is necessary to synchronize repository changes and facilitate seamless collaboration.

Authentication Token: Once the user grants access, the platform obtains an authentication token from the Git provider. This token serves as proof of authentication and is securely stored.

Synchronization of Repositories: Using the authentication token and the APIs provided by the Git provider, the GobletQA Platform pulls in all the user's repositories that were granted access. This includes both public and private repositories.

Selecting Repository and Branch: After successful authentication and repository synchronization, the user is presented with the option to select a repository and branch they would like to use within the GobletQA Platform. They can choose from the available repositories or create a new repository or branch directly from the platform if desired.

Security Measures and User Privacy

The GobletQA Platform prioritizes security and implements measures to ensure user privacy and data protection:

Encryption of Authentication Tokens: The authentication tokens obtained from the Git provider are encrypted and securely stored within the platform. This ensures the confidentiality of the tokens and mitigates the risk of unauthorized access.

Cloned Repository Isolation: Each user's session within the GobletQA Platform is associated with a session container that operates in an isolated environment. When the session container is started, it clones the user's selected repository and checks out the specified branch. This isolation ensures that a user's session and repository are independent of others.

Proxy-Based Access: To access the session container, all requests must pass through a proxy. The proxy authenticates each request using JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication generated from the user's encrypted authentication token. This proxy-based access control adds an extra layer of security, protecting the session container from unauthorized access.

Token Expiration and Session Inactivity: The generated JWT tokens have a limited lifespan. They expire after one hour, upon user sign-out, or if the user's session remains inactive for more than thirty minutes. These measures minimize the risk of prolonged access to a user's session by unauthorized entities.

By following these security practices, the GobletQA Platform ensures that user authentication is handled securely and that user data remains protected throughout their testing sessions.

In the following sections, we will explore the features and functionalities provided by the GobletQA Platform, including the creation of feature files, the execution of tests and automation, and integration with CI/CD systems, enabling users to achieve comprehensive and efficient testing workflows.
