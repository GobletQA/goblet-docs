Learning Curve: Although the platform aims to simplify test creation and automation for non-developers, there may still be a learning curve involved, especially for individuals who are completely new to testing concepts or the Gherkin syntax. Users may need some time to familiarize themselves with the platform's interface and functionality.

Limited Customization: While the platform provides predefined step definitions and the ability to write custom step definitions, there may be cases where users require more complex or specific customization options. The platform's low-code or no-code approach may have limitations in meeting advanced testing requirements or intricate scenarios, potentially requiring users to seek alternative solutions.

Dependency on Git Providers: The authentication process of the GobletQA Platform relies on supported Git providers such as GitHub and GitLab. This means users must have accounts with these providers and grant the necessary permissions for the platform to access their repositories. Users who prefer to work with different version control systems or who do not wish to integrate their accounts with external platforms may find this aspect limiting.

Platform Limitations: As with any software platform, there may be certain limitations or constraints that users encounter. These could include restrictions on resource usage, file size limitations, or compatibility issues with specific browsers or technologies. Users should be aware of these limitations and assess if they align with their testing needs.

Reliance on Third-Party Integrations: The GobletQA Platform relies on several open-source technologies, including Playwright, Kubernetes, Docker, and Jest. While these integrations provide powerful capabilities, they also introduce dependencies on the stability and maintenance of these external technologies. Updates or changes to these integrations could potentially impact the functioning of the platform.

Limited Offline Support: As the GobletQA Platform is primarily cloud-based and relies on session containers in the cloud, users may experience limitations or lack of functionality when working offline or in environments with limited internet connectivity. Users who require offline testing capabilities or have strict network restrictions may face challenges in utilizing the platform effectively.

It's important to consider these downsides alongside the platform's advantages to determine if the GobletQA Platform aligns with specific testing needs and requirements.
