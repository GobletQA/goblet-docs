# Git Providers

To access the Goblet platform, we use a git cloud provider to manage user accounts. Currently, GitHub and GitLab are the only providers available.
<br/>
We plan to add more options soon, including BitBucket, CodeCommit and more.

  See the [authentication](/overview/auth) section for why a Git cloud provider is required
</Callout> 

<br/>

## Github

* **GobletQA platform**
  * Navigate your browser to http://dev.gobletqa.app
  * When presented with the modal to login select the `GitHub` button
  * An external window will open, which will ask you to autozied the GobletQA application
  * Once authorized, the external window will close
  * The Goblet platform will present you with the [Repo Connect](/overview/mounted-repo) modal
  * From the dropdown, select the repo you wish to mount into the session container

<br/>

## GitLab

Due to how Gitlab handles OAuth, an application must be configured **before** logging via the GitLab provider and registering the GobletQA application.
<br/>
This is done in the `oauth/applications` section of the public [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/oauth/applications) of a hosted version of the GitLab application

<br/>

### Configure GitLab OAuth 2.0

> For more information, see [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html)

* **GitLab Account**
  * Create an Application by navigating to `Edit Profile > Applications`
  * In the Add new application form
    * Specify the name `GobletQA` in the **Name** field
    * Next, in Redirect URI field enter `https://dev.gobletqa.app`
  * In the Scopes section, ensure that you select the following check boxes:
    * `api`
    * `email`
    * `openid`
  * Leave the remaining fields empty (default).
  * Click Save application
  * The application should now be created.
  * Note down the `Application ID` and `Secret`
    * This will be used later in Goblet

* **GobletQA platform**
  * Navigate your browser to http://dev.gobletqa.app
  * When presented with the modal to login select the `GitLab` button
  * Then enter in the `Application ID` noted down from the GitLab steps above, and hit `next`
  * An external window will open, which will ask you to autozied the GobletQA application
  * Once authorized, the external window will close
  * The Goblet platform will present you with the [Repo Connect](/overview/mounted-repo) modal
  * From the dropdown, select the repo you wish to mount into the session container

Git Providers

Git providers play a crucial role in the functionality and collaboration capabilities of the GobletQA Platform. This section explores the supported Git providers and their integration within the platform.

Supported Git Providers

The GobletQA Platform currently supports the following Git providers:

GitHub: GitHub is a widely-used web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It offers version control functionality, collaboration features, and extensive community support. The GobletQA Platform integrates seamlessly with GitHub, allowing users to authenticate with their GitHub accounts and access their repositories.

GitLab: GitLab is another popular web-based Git repository management solution. It provides a comprehensive set of features for version control, issue tracking, continuous integration, and more. With the GobletQA Platform's integration with GitLab, users can authenticate using their GitLab accounts and utilize their repositories within the platform.

Bitbucket: Bitbucket is a web-based platform for hosting Git and Mercurial repositories. It offers similar features to other Git providers, including collaboration tools and integrations. Although not directly mentioned, if desired, the GobletQA Platform can also integrate with Bitbucket, providing users with the ability to authenticate and access their Bitbucket repositories.

Authentication Process

The authentication process with Git providers involves the following steps:

User Authorization: When users sign in to the GobletQA Platform, they are prompted to authorize the platform's access to their repositories on the chosen Git provider. This authorization is essential to enable synchronization of repository changes and collaboration functionalities.

Authentication Token: Upon successful authorization, the GobletQA Platform obtains an authentication token from the Git provider. This token serves as proof of authentication and is securely stored within the platform.

API Integration: Leveraging the provided authentication token and the APIs offered by the Git provider, the GobletQA Platform retrieves information about the user's repositories, including both public and private repositories. This integration ensures seamless access to the repositories within the platform.

Repository Selection: After the authentication and synchronization process, users are presented with the option to select a specific repository and branch from their authorized repositories. They can choose an existing repository or create a new one directly from the GobletQA Platform if needed.

Benefits of Git Provider Integration

The integration with Git providers offers several advantages to users:

Collaboration: Users can easily collaborate with teammates by granting access to shared repositories. The integration ensures that all team members can work on the same codebase, facilitating smooth collaboration and streamlined development processes.

Version Control: Git providers provide robust version control capabilities, enabling users to track changes, review commit history, and manage branches effectively. The GobletQA Platform leverages these capabilities, ensuring that users can work with their preferred repository structure and utilize Git's powerful version control features.

Secure Access: By utilizing the authentication mechanisms of the Git providers, the GobletQA Platform ensures that only authorized users can access the repositories. This authentication process enhances the security and integrity of users' code and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.

By integrating with popular Git providers, the GobletQA Platform empowers users to seamlessly access, collaborate, and manage their repositories, leveraging the robust features and security mechanisms offered by these platforms. The next sections will delve into the specific functionalities and capabilities provided by the GobletQA Platform, allowing users to create and execute tests, automate workflows, and integrate with CI/CD systems effectively.
