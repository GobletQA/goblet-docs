# Git Cloud Providers

To access the Goblet platform, we use a git cloud provider to manage user accounts. Currently, GitHub and GitLab are the only providers available.
<br/>
We plan to add more options soon, including BitBucket, CodeCommit and more.

<Callout>
  See the [authentication](/overview/auth) section for why a Git cloud provider is required

<br/>

## Github

* **GobletQA platform**
  * Navigate your browser to http://dev.gobletqa.app
  * When presented with the modal to login select the `GitHub` button
  * An external window will open, which will ask you to autozied the GobletQA application
  * Once authorized, the external window will close
  * The Goblet platform will present you with the [Repo Connect](/overview/mounted-repo) modal
  * From the dropdown, select the repo you wish to mount into the session container

<br/>

## GitLab

Due to how Gitlab handles OAuth, an application must be configured **before** logging via the GitLab provider and registering the GobletQA application.
<br/>
This is done in the `oauth/applications` section of the public [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/oauth/applications) of a hosted version of the GitLab application

<br/>

### Configure GitLab OAuth 2.0

> For more information, see [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html)
