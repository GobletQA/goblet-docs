* **[Architecture](/overview/architecture)**<br/>
  The architecture of the GobletQA Platform is designed to provide a robust and secure environment for creating and executing tests or automation.
  <br/>


* **[Git Provider](/overview/git-providers)**<br/>
  Git cloud providers integrated into the platform providing authentication and access to users repositories
  <br/>


* **[Mounted Repo](/overview/mounted-repo)**<br/>
  After authentication, users can select a repository and branch they want to work with. They can choose from their existing repositories or create new ones directly within the GobletQA Platform.
  <br/>


* **[Conductor](/overview/conductor)**<br/>
  Critical micro-service that sits between the proxy and session container. It acts as an intermediary between the two; managing the lifecycle of session container relative to a users active session.
  <br/>


* **[Session Container Creation](/overview/session-container)**<br/>
  Once a repository and branch are selected, the GobletQA Platform creates a session container, a short-lived virtual machine in the cloud. The container is tied to the user's active session and is responsible for executing tests and automation.
