Integrations

The GobletQA Platform offers seamless integrations with various technologies and tools to enhance its functionality and extend its capabilities. These integrations enable you to leverage existing tools and systems within your testing and automation workflows. Let's explore some of the key integrations supported by the GobletQA Platform:

Playwright Framework: When writing feature files that involve automating a web browser, the GobletQA Platform integrates with the Playwright framework. Playwright provides powerful browser automation capabilities, allowing you to interact with web browsers, perform actions such as clicking, scrolling, and dragging, manipulate the DOM, and more. With this integration, you can write feature files that automate web browser interactions with ease.

Kubernetes and Docker: For executing user-supplied scripts or functions, the GobletQA Platform creates an isolated virtual machine using Kubernetes and Docker. This ensures security and reliability by providing a sandboxed environment to run custom code. The integration with Kubernetes and Docker allows you to execute scripts or functions safely within the platform.

Jest Test Framework: The GobletQA Platform supports writing API and unit tests using JavaScript or TypeScript along with the Jest test framework. Jest is a widely used testing framework that provides a comprehensive set of features for writing and executing tests. You can leverage the full power of Jest within the GobletQA Platform to write robust and reliable tests.

Monaco IDE Editor: The GobletQA Platform offers an integrated Monaco IDE editor that allows you to write tests and automation directly in the browser. Monaco IDE provides a feature-rich coding environment with functionalities such as auto-complete, code highlighting, and full-text search. It enables a smooth and efficient coding experience within the platform.

VNC Session with noVNC: The GobletQA Platform creates a VNC session using noVNC, which allows you to see a fully interactive web browser within your own browser. This feature provides real-time visibility into the execution of tests and automation as you create them. It significantly reduces the feedback loop between writing code and observing its execution, enhancing your development experience.

Git CLI Integration: The GobletQA Platform seamlessly integrates with the Git command-line interface (CLI) to handle changes made by users within the platform. All changes to the repository are automatically saved by utilizing the Git CLI to commit and push the changes to a remote Git repository. This integration simplifies version control and facilitates easy sharing of repository files among team members.

The integrations provided by the GobletQA Platform enhance your testing and automation capabilities by leveraging popular technologies and tools. These integrations allow you to automate web browsers, execute custom scripts securely, write API and unit tests using Jest, utilize a powerful code editor, observe real-time execution, and seamlessly manage code changes using Git. By harnessing these integrations, you can create comprehensive and robust tests and automation workflows within the GobletQA Platform.
