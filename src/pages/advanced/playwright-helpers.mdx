### `saveContextState(context: TBrowserContext, location?: string): Promise<TContextStorageState>`

This asynchronous function is used to save the storage state of a Playwright BrowserContext into a file. It takes a `context` parameter, which should be a Playwright BrowserContext object whose storage state you want to save. Additionally, you can specify an optional `location` parameter to customize the path and filename of the saved storage state. The function returns a Promise that resolves to a `TContextStorageState` object representing the saved storage state.

### `getContext(): Promise<TBrowserContext>`

This asynchronous function retrieves the current Playwright BrowserContext instance. If a browser context does not exist, it throws an error indicating that no context has been created yet. It returns a Promise that resolves to a Playwright BrowserContext object.

---

### `getPage(num: number = 0, fromClosePage: boolean = false): Promise<TBrowserPage>`

This asynchronous function gets a Playwright browser page instance by number or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. You can specify the `num` parameter to retrieve a specific page by its index, and the `fromClosePage` parameter determines whether a new page should be created if none exist. It returns a Promise that resolves to a Playwright BrowserPage object.

---

### `getLastActivePage(): TBrowserPage | undefined`

This function returns the last active Playwright BrowserPage instance. If no active page exists, it returns `undefined`.

---

### `runInBrowser(props: TRunInBrowser, callback: (...args: any[]) => any): Promise<any>`

This asynchronous function is a utility for running a callback function in a browser context. It takes two parameters:
- `props`: An object containing the following properties:
  - `cb`: The callback function to be executed in the browser context.
  - `opts`: Optional data that can be passed to the callback.
  - `locator`: A Playwright locator that identifies an element in the browser.
  - `selector`: A CSS selector string to locate an element in the browser.

If no `locator` or `selector` is provided, it executes the callback in the main page context. If a `locator` or `selector` is provided, it finds the element and executes the callback on it.

- **Returns:** A Promise that resolves to the result of executing the callback in the browser context.

---

### `mediaIsFinished(props: TMediaIsPlayingSel | TMediaIsPlayingLoc): Promise<boolean>`

This asynchronous function checks whether a media element has finished playing in the browser. It takes one parameter, `props`, which can be either a `TMediaIsPlayingSel` or `TMediaIsPlayingLoc` object. These objects define whether the media element is located by a CSS selector (`selector`) or a Playwright locator (`locator`).

- **Returns:** A Promise that resolves to a boolean value indicating whether the media element has finished playing.

---

### `getLocatorType(selector: string, type: string | TLocatorTypeKey = 'text', options: TGetLocationOpts = emptyObj): Promise<TLocator>`

- `type`: An optional string or a `TLocatorTypeKey` indicating the type of locator to use. The default is `'text'`.
- `options`: An optional object containing additional options for locating the element.

The function determines the locator type based on the `type` parameter and uses the appropriate Playwright method to locate the element. It returns a Promise that resolves to a Playwright `TLocator` object representing the located element. If the element is not found, it throws an error.
